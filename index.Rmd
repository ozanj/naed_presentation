# Motivation
## The problem with policy discourse about college access

The 2014 White House "Access Summit"

- White House (2014b) review of causes of unequal college access
    - Highlights achievement gap, "under-matching"
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity* (The White House, 2014a)
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")

Problem with policy discourse
- Focus on deficiencies of students, K-12 schools
- Assumes universities are passive or progressive actors

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities and behaviors biased against low-income students and/or communities of color
- Recruiting behavior an indicator of enrollment preferences
- This project analyzes off-campus recruiting visits by public research universities

# Background
## The enrollment management industry

<img src="assets/img/New-Admissions-Funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:50%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Recruiting interventions**:
* Identify prospects
    - Purchase "student lists"
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * __Off-campus recruiting (e.g., high
school visits, fairs)__
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising

# Background
## Scholarship on college access

Most research on access focuses on "demand side"
- Response to aid
- "under-matching": high-achieving, low-income students lack information/guidance
    - Interventions to overcome information asymmetries, nudge students

Few studies analyze recruiting

- Audits of university resonse to inquiries
- Off-campus recruiting visits
    - College perspective (Stevens, 2007): important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
    - Student/high school perspective (Holland, forthcoming): Which universities visit affects student decisions, especially first-generation and students of color

Research gap

- Access depends on which universities visit your school
- We don't know which universities visit which schools

# Theoretical motivation
## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior

Organizational theory

- Contingency theory (Thompson, 1967)
    - Technical level vs. managerial level
- "New" institutional theory (Meyer & Rowan, 1977)
    - Publicly adopt goals demanded by environment
    - Technical level cannot pursue all goals
    - Substantively adopt some goals (technical level)
    - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric)

Application to enrollment management

- "iron triangle" of enrollment management
    - Universities pursue three enrollment goals: access, academic profile, tuition revenue
- Recruiting is allocation of resources from technical level
    - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting is indicator of enrollment priorities
