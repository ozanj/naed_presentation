# Motivation
## The problem with policy discourse about college access

The 2014 White House "Access Summit" `r citep("10.1016/j.econedurev.2016.02.009")`

- White House (2014b) review of causes of unequal college access
    - Highlights achievement gap, "under-matching"
- *Commitments to Action on College Opportunity* (The White House, 2014a)
    - Universities pledge "action plans" (e.g., holistic admission, need-based aid, "outreach")

Problem with policy discourse
- Focus on deficiencies of students, K-12 schools
- Assumes universities are passive or progressive actors

Alternative explanation for access inequality
- University enrollment priorities and behaviors biased against low-income students and/or communities of color
- Recruiting behavior an indicator of enrollment preferences
- This project analyzes off-campus recruiting visits by public research universities

# Background
## The enrollment management industry

*** =left

**The enrollment funnel**:

<img src="assets/img/New-Admissions-Funnel.png" alt="Enrollment Funnel" style="width:70%;float:left;">

*** =right

**Recruiting interventions**:
* Identify prospects
    - Purchase "student lists"
* Recruit prospects remotely
    * Email, mail, text, etc.
* Recruit prospects in-person
    * __Off-campus recruiting (e.g., high
school visits, fairs)__
    * Campus visits
    * Other "outreach"
* Solicit inquiries, stealth applicants
    * Social media, advertising

# Literature review
## Scholarship on the enrollment funnel

Most research analyzes admissions or financial aid
- Final stages of enrollment funnel

Scholarship on recruiting
- Audits of university resonse to inquiries [CITE]

- Off-campus recruiting visits
    - College perspective (Stevens, 2007)
        - important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
    - Student/high school perspective (Holland, forthcoming): 
        - Which universities visit affects student decisions, especially first-generation and students of color

Research gap
- We don't know which universities visit which schools and communities
- If poor students, communities of color not being recruited, then "under-matching" may be due to under-recruiting rather than lack of guidance

<!--

# Background
## Scholarship on college access

Most research on access focuses on "demand side"
- Response to aid
- "under-matching": high-achieving, low-income students lack information/guidance
    - Interventions to overcome information asymmetries, nudge students

Few studies analyze recruiting

- Audits of university resonse to inquiries
- Off-campus recruiting visits
    - College perspective (Stevens, 2007): important for relationships with prospects, counselors at "feeder" schools
    - Student/high school perspective (Holland, forthcoming): Which universities visit affects student decisions, especially first-generation and students of color

Research gap

- Access depends on which universities visit your school
- We don't know which universities visit which schools

# Theoretical motivation
## Enrollment priorities and recruiting behavior

Organizational theory

- Contingency theory (Thompson, 1967)
    - Technical level vs. managerial level
- "New" institutional theory (Meyer & Rowan, 1977)
    - Publicly adopt goals demanded by environment
    - Technical level cannot pursue all goals
    - Substantively adopt some goals (technical level)
    - Symbolically adopt others (policies, rhetoric)

Application to enrollment management

- "iron triangle" of enrollment management
    - Universities pursue three enrollment goals: access, academic profile, tuition revenue
- Recruiting is allocation of resources from technical level
    - Knowing which populations targeted by recruiting is indicator of enrollment priorities

## Overview of off-campus recruiting project

**Data collection**

* Method
    - Web-scrape admissions websites
* Criteria to be included in data collection
    1. Post visits on admissions websites
    2. Organizational type
* Data collection sample [CRYSTAL - CHECK?]
    - 49 public research universities
    - 49 private research universities
    - 42 selective private liberal arts
* Data collection period
    - 1/1/2017 to 12/31/2017
    - Ongoing data collection with larger sample

# Research design
## Focus of the present paper

Guiding research question:
- What are the similarities and differences in off-campus recruiting patterns across public research universities?

Why this research question: 
- First paper from the larger study
- Explore behavior inductively, rather than test specific hypotheses
- Subsequent papers more focused, thematic (e.g., racial red-lining)

Why focus on public research universities:
- Historic mission of social mobility for state residents
- Decline in state funding, growth in nonresident enrollment (Jaquette &
Curs, 2015)
- What are they doing to get all these nonresident students? More effort recruiting nonresidents than residents?

# Research design
## Defining events

Off-campus recruiting events: events by paid staff or consultants focused on soliciting applications
- Event Type
    - Include: College fairs, high school visits, community college visits,
counselor events
    - Exclude: interviews, admitted or committed student events
- Event Host
    - Include: paid admissions staff or consultants (e.g. regional
    - Exclude: alumni, student volunteers
recruiters)
- Event location
    - Any off-campus location
    - E.g., high school, community college, hotel, convention center, cafe, etc.

--- 

# Research design
## Data collection, processing, quality

Data collection
- University website checked four times per year by two staff for URLs with recruiting events
- Web-scraping scripts run once per week

Data processing
- "Parsing": transform HTML text into tabular data
- "Geocoding": use Google Maps API to obtain detailed location data based on limited data
- Merge recruiting data to secondary data (e.g., school data, community data)

Data quality (are these data any good?)
- Concern 1: Are scraped events properly classified and merged to secondary data
    - Solution: manually check each scraped event
        - 8 of 15 universities checked thus far
- Concern 2: Are all events posted on admissions website
    - Solution: issue public records requests for all off-cmapus recruiting events
        - Received data from X universities; not yet incorporated

# Research design
## Secondary data

Secondary data Sources:

- NCES Common Core of Data (public high schools)
- NCES Private School University Survey (private high schools)
- U.S. Census American Community Survey (community characteristics)
- IPEDS (community colleges)
- EdFacts Initiative (public high school academic achievement)
- Equality of Opportunity Project (university income
distributions)

# Research design
## Research design for analyses

Quantitative multiple case study design
- "quantitative case study": case study where quantitative data is used as the sole source of evidence (Korzilius, 2010)

Comparison to alternative research designs
- Large-N, random samplying
    - Not possible because reruiting data unavailable for random sample
    - Not desirable for our RQ because large-N designs pool results across cases
- Qualitative case study (usually collect data from multiple sources)
    - Develop more holistic view of recruiting (e.g., Stevens, 2007)
    - Less systematic analysis of particular phenomena

Data analysis
- Within-case analyses
    - Situate within local context; national overview; "deep dive" of in-state and out-of-state recruiting patterns
    - Simple descriptive statistics (e.g., counts), static visualizations, interactive maps
- Cross-case analyses

--- 

# Research design
## Analysis sample compared to population

Analysis sample consists of 15 public research universities
- Chosen based on "completeness" of recruiting event data
- Subsequent drafts may reduce sample size, based on case study principles of "purposeful sampling" (Patton, 2002)

CRYSTALL - INSERT TABLE OF SAMPLE COMPARED TO POPULATION
